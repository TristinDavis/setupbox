h1. What?

*setupbox* copies a users ssh-key to a one or more servers, and adds the key to
~/.ssh/authorized_keys.

*setupbox* then copies a directory of files to the same one or more 
remote servers using scp/ssh, which now happens automaticly since we have installed
the ssh key :)

h1. Why?

*setupbox* is a little utility that started development since the servers at work
lacked shared storage. I got tired of retyping ssh-key copy, vimrc setup, plugins, 
environment etc. So I wrote a simple tool.
